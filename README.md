## noid

`noid` is a key-value store. Its name is pronounced like /nəʊ aɪˈdɪə/, or *no idea*.
That is because we have no idea if `noid` will ever outgrow the pet-project-stage.
The `docs/` project directory contains documentation about `noid` APIs, internals like architecture,
design patterns and on-disk file formats.
